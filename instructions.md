You are an expert AI engineer. Your task is to generate a **Python skeleton** for a proactive skill-gap management system. The system uses AI agents to detect upcoming skill gaps in projects and recommend whether to upskill, transfer, or hire employees. Follow these requirements carefully:

---

### 1. Architecture
The system should follow a **layered cognitive model**:

- **Perception**: Ingest project definitions in natural language (from Notion, Jira, Confluence, PDFs, etc.). For now, this can be mocked. Extract required skills, levels, deadlines, and importance.  
- **Short-Term / Working Memory**: Ephemeral state per project ingestion run, holding extracted requirements, candidate employees, partial plans, and constraints.  
- **Long-Term Memory**: Store a skill graph, employee skill history, project history, prior decisions, and outcomes.  
- **Cognition**: Analyze skill gaps, make decisions (upskill, transfer, hire), perform feasibility and cost modeling, and optimize across multiple projects.  
- **Action**: Generate training plans, transfers, job postings, and schedule updates.  
- **Reflection**: Record outcomes, update skill levels, and improve decision models.

---

### 2. Agents
Define agents as **MCP servers** with callable tools:

- Project Intake Agent
- Skill Extraction Agent
- Workforce Data Agent
- Gap Analysis Agent
- Recommendation Agent

Each agent should have **function stubs** with input/output types, internal reasoning (ReAct-style), and produce **structured outputs only**.

---

### 3. Reasoning & Best Practices
- Use **ReAct-style internal reasoning**, but agents must output only **structured Python objects or JSON**. No freeform text for DecisionRecords or trace logs.  
- Include **confidence scores**, **alternatives considered**, and **evidence** for every recommendation.  
- Keep a **trace log** of tool calls, inputs, and outputs for auditability.  
- Normalize skills with a **canonical skill taxonomy**.  
- Include feasibility checks: upskill time, transfer impact, hire lead time.  
- Support **multi-project optimization** to avoid conflicts and maximize coverage.

---

### 4. Technical Notes
- Agents expose **MCP tools** (`list_tools`, JSON-RPC over HTTP or stdio).  
- The orchestrator acts as **MCP client**, calling agents dynamically.  
- UI layer can be **Streamlit** or **FastAPI**, querying the orchestrator.  
- Mock the use of **vector stores** (FAISS or Pinecone) for embeddings of project documents and employee skill info.  
- Majority of the data should be in natural language. Use LLMs to understand the data and, if needed, parse them and store in a JSON format
- Mock the storage of structured data in **Postgres** or **Neo4j**, ephemeral state in **Redis** or in-process memory.  
- All external connectors (Notion, Jira, HRIS, LMS) should be mocked with dummy data but tools should exist so agents can call them.

---

### 5. Output Requirements
- Provide a **LangGraph/agent skeleton** including:
  - State definitions (`Requirement`, `Candidate`, `Gap`, `DecisionRecord`, etc.)
  - Agent node stubs with inputs and outputs
  - Example **trace log structure**
  - Example **DecisionRecord JSON**
- Include **best-practice comments** for reasoning transparency, evidence tracking, and future extensibility.  
- Do not use any real employee data; use placeholders/dummy data.  

---

### 6. Data Handling
- Initial project definitions and employee skillsets should be stored in **natural language** and processed by an LLM within the agent workflow.  
- The skeleton should support later ingestion of real structured or semi-structured data.

---

### 7. Communication Protocol
- Use **MCP (FastMCP)** for agent tool calls wherever possible.  
- Use **FastAPI** only for human-facing UI/API endpoints.  
- Include mocked MCP endpoints for external sources (Notion, Jira, HRIS, LMS) with sample return data.

---

Please generate **Python code skeleton** that implements this system with:

- Agent stubs
- State models
- Example DecisionRecords and trace logs
- Placeholder/mock data
- MCP integration points ready for later implementation

Focus on **clean, maintainable structure** suitable for immediate integration into a multi-agent orchestration framework like LangGraph or MCP.
