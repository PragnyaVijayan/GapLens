I'll also consider market trends to determine which skills are most valuable.\n\n### Evaluate\nI'll analyze:\n1. Required skills for upcoming projects\n2. Current skills across all teams\n3. Market demand and trends for skills\n\n### Work\nLet me identify the required skills for all upcoming projects and compare them with our current team's skills.\n\n**Required Skills for Upcoming Projects:**\n- Salesforce CRM Implementation: Salesforce, Apex, Lightning, JavaScript, SQL\n- Data Pipeline Optimization: Python, Apache Spark, Kafka, PostgreSQL, Docker\n- Mobile App for Field Sales: React Native, TypeScript, Node.js, MongoDB, AWS\n- AI-Powered Customer Support: Python, TensorFlow, NLP, FastAPI, PostgreSQL\n\n**Current Team Skills:**\n- Frontend Team: React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Vue.js, TypeScript, Sass, Angular\n- Backend Team: Python, Django, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, AWS\n- Data Science Team: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, SQL, TensorFlow\n- DevOps Team: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Terraform, Jenkins, Linux\n\n### Observe\nBased on my analysis, I've identified the following skill gaps:\n\n**Major Skill Gaps:**\n1. **Salesforce Ecosystem**: No team members have Salesforce, Apex, or Lightning skills, which are required for the CRM implementation project.\n2. **Data Engineering**: Missing Apache Spark and Kafka skills needed for the data pipeline project.\n3. **Mobile Development**: No React Native expertise for the mobile app project.\n4. **NoSQL Databases**: No MongoDB skills for the mobile app project.\n5. **Node.js**: Missing for the mobile app project.\n6. **NLP (Natural Language Processing)**: Required for the AI customer support project but not present in the team.\n7. **FastAPI**: Needed for the AI project but not available in the team.\n\n**Secondary Skill Gaps:**\n1. Backend team has only one member, creating a potential bottleneck.\n2. Limited TypeScript expertise (only one team member with advanced skills).\n3. Limited SQL skills (only intermediate level in the data science team).\n\n### Optimize\nBased on market data and project requirements, I recommend prioritizing the following skill acquisitions:\n\n## Skill Gaps Summary\n\n### Critical Skill Gaps (High Priority)\n1. **Salesforce Ecosystem** (Salesforce, Apex, Lightning)\n   - Required for high-priority CRM project\n   - Medium market demand and supply\n   - No current team expertise\n\n2. **React Native**\n   - Essential for high-priority mobile app project\n   - Related to existing React skills but requires specific mobile expertise\n   - No current team expertise\n\n3. **NLP (Natural Language Processing)**\n   - Required for AI customer support project\n   - Growing field in AI/ML (rising skill trend)\n   - No current team expertise\n\n### Significant Skill Gaps (Medium Priority)\n1. **Data Engineering Tools** (Apache Spark, Kafka)\n   - Required for data pipeline optimization\n   - Part of rising \"Data Engineering\" trend\n   - No current team expertise\n\n2. **Node.js & MongoDB**\n   - Required for mobile app project\n   - Common backend technologies for modern applications\n   - No current team expertise\n\n3. **FastAPI**\n   - Modern Python framework needed for AI project\n   - Complements existing Python skills\n   - No current team expertise\n\n### Team Structure Gaps\n1. **Backend Team Understaffing**\n   - Single member creates risk and bottleneck\n   - Consider expanding this team to support multiple projects\n\n2. **Mobile Development Capability**\n   - No dedicated mobile developers\n   - Consider creating a mobile development capability\n\nThese skill gaps should be addressed through a combination of hiring, training existing staff with high upskilling capacity, and potentially engaging contractors for specialized short-term needs like Salesforce implementation.",
